Luhn Algorithm
Build Status

This is just a quick port of the Luhn Algorithm, generally used for validating Credit Card details, to Objective-C (iOS).

Instructions

Import the header:

#import "Luhn.h"
Call the class method returning a BOOL as to whether the string is valid or not:

BOOL isValid = [Luhn validateString:@"some credit card number"];

if (isValid) {
// process payment
}
else {
// alert user
}
